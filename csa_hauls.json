This season we will be creating a blog each week with 5 detailed recipes which utilize many, if not all of the ingredients in the week's package. This week's share includes many perennial herbs, which take off faster in the spring than the annual crops and offer an abundance of unique flavors. Check out our week 1 recipes below!"

We included a light spring soup which uses many spring herbs, the Dutch Herb Soup. A variation of this recipe is suggested to originate as early as the mid 17th century. The recipe we included is a based on Christiane Muusers recipe translation from the original cookbook Keukenboek by Henriette Davidis from 1868. The original recipe calls for potato dumplings, which we swapped for plain potatoes due to time constraints, but we would encourage those who are slightly more ambitious to make potato dumplings or replace the potatoes with gnocchi."

      "message": "We have lots of tasty summer vegetables included in the share this week. The recipes don't use a lot of ingredients that aren't in your bag. Since we are in the heart of grilling season we used the grill for most of the meals. The corn didn't get as big as we would have liked but it is very delicious. The corn in your shares were picked that morning which helps retain nutrient content and makes the corn extra sweet. It's best to eat corn as soon as you can after it is picked. We included two ways to grill the corn. We recommend grilling corn instead of boiling it. When you boil corn you loose all of its water soluble nutrients. We hope you enjoy these summertime recipes!"

      "message": "The five recipes below provide a nice balance to one's weekly meals, with a soup, a salad, a sauteed green, and two starch heavy dishes- one rice, one pasta. This week we included a savory herb mix which contains seven unique herbs. Four of the herbs are easily distinguishable- sage (large, smooth leaves), oregano (smaller fuzzy leaves with a rigid stem and some flowers), marjoram (tiny leaves with a highly aromatic, florally flavor), and lavender (beautiful purple flowers with a heavenly aroma). The other three look and taste very similar, but upon close inspection they each have unique characteristics. The most easily differentiated is winter savory, which has smooth firm leaves and a spicy bite. As a hardy perennial this plant has a woody and semi-evergreen appearance. It's cousin, summer savory, is not as hardy, and it's small leaves and tender stems contain a less bitter bite, but still have a very complex aromatic flavor. The last herb included in the mix is thyme, which is the most mild flavored of the three, and also has the most tender leaves. The best way to use the herb mix is to strip all the leaves from the stems and finely chop everything together. To dry the mix for later use spread the herbs in a thin layer on your countertop and allow to dry over several days, and then place the mix to a sealed contained. Try the recipes below to find out how versatile this mix of herbs really is!"

We also want to mention the kale and bean soup. This is a great soup that will fill you up. A quick note on the herbs included this week- baby celery greens and parsley are obvious cousins, but they can be differentiated by the deeper green and thinner stems of the parsley, but most obviously with a little taste. It's amazing something that two greens that look so similar can have such distinct tastes. We hope you all enjoy the recipes this week!"

      "message": "This week we\u2019ve included a lot of the lovely fruits of summer- tomatoes, peppers, and tomatillos. Though tomatillos are most commonly used in a salsa verde, they\u2019re also delicous in soup, like in the recipe below. We also included rutabaga, which is a milder and meatier cousin of turnips and radishes. Rutabaga can be used as a potato substitute, but is also tasty raw, with hints of kohlrabi and cabbage in the flavor. All of the gardens have been soaking up this sunshine and within a few weeks we should have mature winter squash. We\u2019ve been seeding and caring for our fall and winter transplants, so we\u2019re well prepared for a bountiful summer and fall. Enjoy this week\u2019s vegetables!"

We grow several different types heirloom tomatoes which you will get to sample throughout the season. This week most of the heirlooms included are either pink brandywine or chocolate stripe. We also included the first of the passilla bajoi peppers, which are used to make mexican mole sauce, and an early sweet banana pepper, with many more on the way! last year we grew a variety of super hot peppers which made a super hot sauce, but otherwise overpowered everything when cooking. So this year we made it a point to grow peppers that aren\u2019t super hot but have more sweetness and complex flavors. We hope you enjoy the share this week!"

Gazpacho soup is a perfect applicaiton for raw tomatoes, and we included a delicious recipe below. Luckily all of this rain has been a blessing for us because all of our fields have great drainage, and these cold temperatures won\u2019t hurt our tomatoes, eggplant, peppers, and cucumbers because they are all protected in high tunnels. We\u2019ve begun transplanting our fall crops and our fields are still loaded so we will have many more vegetables for you on the way! Thank you for supporting our farm."

The mexican mint marigold (glossy leaves with little orange flowers) pairs with the Russian Tarragon (long skinny leaves) to add more anise flavor which results in a flavor similar to traditional French tarragon. This tarragon combination pairs well with chicken and fish. Also included is sage, which makes everything more fragrant. The carrot tops also make a useful herb, and when used with parsley they make a delicious chimichurri sauce (recipe on blog!). Have fun experimenting with some new flavors this week!"

This week we included buffy squash, which has a sweet flesh, and can be stored for 6 months on your countertop. Like all winter squash it is delicious boiled, mashed, baked, roasted, stuffed, and even microwaved. Also, keep in mind any vegetables you don\u2019t get to throughout the week store well for winter when blanched and frozen. Let us know how you use your veggies and tag us @Front9farm!"

The winter squash this week is baby blue hubbard which has a sweet and savory flesh. Also included are sweet bunching onions, which have a small tender white bulb and fresh greens which are delicious in any typical onion application. Two of the herbs this week are thyme and winter savory. Winter savory is related to summer savory, and has oblong leaves with a bit of spiciness. Thyme has a gentle flavor with lemony and minty tones. Enjoy the share and have a wonderful week!"

These are the meatiest of the tomatoes which makes them perfect for sauces, salsas, and soups. We also included the first of our sweet corn, which we hope to include a few more times this season. The corn was harvested hours before the dropoff so it\u2019s near peak sugar content! We also included ground cherries, a sweet relative of tomatoes and tomatillos, which is another crop we will include more of from now until the end of the season. We hope you enjoy the variety this week, and thank you for supporting our farm!"

We also included some tasty summer treats- sweet corn and cantaloupe. We included a mix of pink brandywine and old German heirloom tomatoes. The flavor of both is exceptional, but they are highly perishable so we would recommend removing them from the paper bag to slow the ripening, and eating them within a few days.

Butternut is a favorite winter squash among many CSA members and we have it again for you this week. We have some big projects coming up on the farm. There are a few more crops to transplant and then we will be installing hoops and covering a large portion of the garden, about 1/3rd of an acre, in greenhoiuse film and row cover. We plan to keep many cold-tolerant crops going throughout the winter months. Check our instagram and facebook this winter to see what winter markets we will be attending."

The tatsoi is delicious to both humans and the flee beetles (tiny bite holes), and obviously pesticide-free. Similarly, the Chinese cabbage has sized up nicely but the early heat this past week has sent the plants into flowering. The brassica family is always a gamble in the spring but the nutritional and flavorful benefits make those crops worth the trouble. Thank you all for supporting us!"

We also included some other delicious fruits of summer which combine to make the perfect fresh salsa. We hope you enjoy this week\u2019s share and thank you for supporting our farm and have a great week!"

The green onion is a Japanese bunching onion which is a perennial harvested as a cut-and-come-again crop, and is delicious both raw and cooked.

We try to use minimal packaging so and leafy produce should be stored in plasticware or plastic bags to keep it humid. \u00a0If you dont know how to store something ask us and we will be happy to help. We love seeing the food you make so if you ever share something on social media make sure to tag @front9farm.This week\u2019s share has a lot of great spring greens. We also included delicious, and nutritious wild springtime ramps from our woods, nature\u2019s gift. Thank you all for supporting us and our farm!"

      "message": "Week two is here, and these long spring days have provided us with another bounty of delicious produce. We loved seeing all the meals that you guys made with the share last week. This week we have more delicious spring greens. Now that the weather is cooperating we have finally started planting our summer crops out in the fields. This week we included a nice bulk bag of brassica greens, which are delicious sauteed. The heavier leafy greens will be included more in the earlier share of the season so if make sure you freeze them for use in summer if you\u2019re not eating them fast enough. If you don\u2019t know what to do with the brassica mix we highly recommend you make the pasta dish below. We try to make all the recipes has healthy as possible with minimal ingredients, and minimal animal products, but they can always modified to include more fats and cheeses, and can be served as side along a slice of meat. Thank you all for supporting us! Have a great week!"

      "message": "We survived the heat wave earlier this week, which the summer crops loved, and they should be producing fruit soon after soaking up all this sunshine. We planted tomatoes and peppers very early and usually end up cutting off the first fruit before it fully matures to allow the plants to grow bigger and produce more peppers in the long term, which is why the pepper in your bag is so petite. Soon the tomatoes and peppers will be producing lots of fruit and you will recieve larger quantities in the share. Spring is the best season for greens, so we included a full half pound of salad mix in the share this week. Us and our wonderful crew have been hard at work putting many many trays of everything from summer squash, to winter squash, to onions, and beans, in the ground, which will be ready for harvest during peak summer. We hope you\u2019ve been enjoying the spring vegetables, and we thank you for supporting our farm!"

Carrots are just starting to size up so we included a small bunch this week, with much more on the way in the future. The chimichurri recipe below and on the website is a great way to use the carrot tops so nothing goes to waste. The summer crops are just around the corner, and day by day we\u2019ve been watching the summer fruits and vegetables size up. Enjoy the spring veggies while they last and have a great week!"

We wish we could \u00a0coax fruit out of the many of the crops we\u2019ve been caring for since January, but it takes time. We hope you enjoy the variety this week, and make sure you eat the greens of all the crops as well as the roots/bulbs. They\u2019re delicious in their own right.

They would be great in a dish but taste great eaten raw as a snack. One of the benefits of our CSA is that we harvest everything the day of or the day before you get it, so if you keep everything cool and humid, produce items should last a week or two.

They should start making it into the bags within the next couple of weeks. Our zucchini got a little away from us this week so they are a little bigger than the size we usually pick. This just makes for a bigger meal. The website has a delicious sauteed red lettuce recipe, a dish which symbolizes wealth and prosperity in Chinese culture. it\u2019s a great use of the greens which are more bitter than bibb lettuce, especially this time of year, but have a much higher nutritional value. All of the meals this week are nice and light and use very minimal additional ingredients. We figured this was best after a long weekend of brats and beer. Happy 4th of july!"

It is called Delicata because it has a delicate skin that you don\u2019t have to peel. We coated it with honey and grilled it in the recipes this week. Also making an appearance for the first time is Asian eggplant. This was used in a delicious stir fry with the collard greens and peppers. We\u2019ve had a busy week as we\u2019re always thinking one season ahead- we\u2019ve been seeding and transplanting tray after tray of fall and winter vegetables. \u00a0We hope you enjoy the share this week!"

Anytime the greens of the root crops (beets, carrots, etc.) are in at least OK shape we try to include them so you can cook with those as well, but when they haven\u2019t fared well against the weather, insects (we don\u2019t spray any insecticides), and hungry deer, we\u2019ve been removing them more consistently. If you try the beet salsa recipe this week (on the website) we hope you find the main takeaway is that you can make delicious salsa out of nearly any vegetable. We also highly recommend the two part recipe below due to the versatility of the creamed greens, as well as the pickled stems. A quick pickle can perk up nearly any share item you aren\u2019t sure what to do with. \u00a0Have a great week!"

Butternut Squash makes its first appearence in the bag this week. We used it in a soup with the swish chard but it is also great roasted with some sausage or any other way you like to enjoy it. You will get a lot of different winter squash for the rest of the year, and it all keeps really well so if you dont get around to making it right away it will store on the countertop for months. We\u2019ve reached peak tomato season so enjoy them while they last- they won\u2019t be around forever. Thank you so much for supporting us and our farm!"

We are able to keep our summer crops growing in the greenhouse and the cooler season crops do well outside. We also dont have to worry about losing crops to pest as much. We are still hanging on to summer a little bit with a lot of great salsa ingredients in the bag this week. The recipe on the flyer this week is for a roasted salsa with tomatillos. We make a lot of salsa throughout the summer and we find that roasting the vegetables, especially the tomatillos, adds a nice depth of flavor to the salsa. We hope you all are having a great week!"

We included a leek in the share this week, and there will be more in the future. Leeks are great as the base for soup. We used the leek, carrots and peppers in a soup recipe that is delicous. It is a nice fall soup that goes great with grilled cheese or just a nice slice of bread. We also included ground cherries for the first time this week. Ground cherries are in the tomato family but they are very sweet and almost have a pineapple taste to them. Make sure to remove the husk before you eat them. Most of you will probably eat them as a snack but they are great on salads, salsas, or spread on toast with cream cheese. Have a great week!"

Many cold-tolerant crops only need protection from the dry cold air dessicating them. The upside of the cold weather is that the greens become sweeter after a few frosts as they increase their sugar storage in their leaves to help them survive the cold, and pest pressure is reduced.

If you\u2019re new to our program, here are some things that you should know- we include one recipe on this flyer, but we also have four more recipes on our website (front9farm.com/recipes) that use all of the produce in the share. We try to use minimal packaging so any leafy produce should be stored in plasticware or plastic bags to keep it humid. If you dont know how to store something ask us and we will be happy to help. We love seeing the food you make so if you ever share something on social media make sure to tag @front9farm.This week\u2019s share has a lot of great spring vegetables.

Be sure to use the full greens of both the leeks and the red bunching onions. \u00a0If you follow us on social media you know that some of our summer crops are ahead of schedule, and will be here before you know it.

Our broccoli crop was a bit stunted from the spring rain, so the initial \u00a0heads are small, but we should be able to have nice lateral cuttings once the plants grow larger. These are some of the tastiest carrots and radishes we\u2019ve grown, and the roasted carrot recipe is delicious.

We have been busy filling these in with fall and winter crops, as well as more strawberry beds. One of our goals this year was to include more peas, beans, and sweet corn in the shares, and we\u2019re pleased we\u2019ve nearly reached our goal. This was the last picking of our beans until our fall succession is ready to harvest, and we have a large crop of sweet corn nearly ready for harvest. Barring an apocalyptic raccoon raid, we should have sweet corn included in the share in the next week or two. Enjoy the fresh produce in this week\u2019s share. Have a great week!"

      "message": "We have another great bag with a bountiful summer harvest this week. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 We recommend cooking the broccoli greens using the most popular method to cook collard greens- in a liquid over low heat until they are tender. We actually grow them in place of collard greens because we find they\u2019re more versatile, since they also produce florets, and they survive the heat, pest, and disease pressure of summer just as well, if not better, than collards or kale. This is probably our heaviest bag yet, so hopefully you lifted with two hands. This will be the only time we include kabocha squash since the plants have started to fade from pest pressure, and because the tender skin of the squash reduces its shelf life, especially when the skin becomes mottled due to beetle bites. The tenderness of the skin also makes it tasty to eat, so if you roast it, don\u2019t skip the skin!"

Labor is the lifeblood of every farm, and that\u2019s especcialy true for a vegetable operation like ours. we\u2019re adding 4 new farm crew members now that 6 of our summer workers have headed off to college.

Our peppers got a late start because we lost a lot of seedlings back in March & April to a soilborne disease caused by too much moisture and too low of temperatures.

We\u2019ll fiinish right before Thanksgiving, which doesn\u2019t feel that far off with this cool wet weather we\u2019ve been having. We have a great mix of cool season vegetables sizing up in the fields to be included in those final weeks. This week we included the last of our winter squash for the CSA season. It\u2019s a cross between a butternut and a pumpkin call a butterkin. The flavor is sweet and savory, and it\u2019s great roasted, sauteed, or in baked goods. \u00a0We hope you enjoy the vegetables, have a great week!"

When we see projected nightly temperatures crossing below 32F we\u2019ll start to pull down the greenhouse film we have secured to the tops of our low tunnels, and that will give us another few degrees of heat retention. Together those coverings allow us to keep tomatos/peppers/eggplant/ground cherries going until a hard frost at 28F or below. Everything else we have planted tolerates light frosts and we\u2019ll only start covering when the hard frosts hit. We included fresh potatoes in the share this week, which haven\u2019t been cured, so their skin is delicate. \u00a0We hope you\u2019re enjoying this fall weather, and have a great week!"

We try to use minimal packaging so any leafy produce should be stored in plasticware or plastic bags to keep it humid. If you dont know how to store something ask us and we will be happy to help. We love seeing the food you make so if you ever share something on social media make sure to tag @front9farm.We have a great share to start the season.

The tomatoes should be shortly after that. \nWe\u2019ve included three members of the allium family- green garlic, green onions, and leeks. The green onions have tubular leaves, and the leeks and garlic have flat leaves. The leaves of the green garlic are spicier than the leek leaves, which have a more onion-like flavor. We recommend slicing the leeks very thinly, especially to cut through the firmness of the flowering stalk, and then also finely chopping the leaves and flowering head. then sauteeing everything until golden brown. You can also put the leeks in a food processor or blender and then carmelizing to achieve a spreadable consistency, perfect for sandwiches or burgers. We hope you have a wonderful Memorial Day weekend!"

This week we included flowering leeks, which put out scapes just like garlic, and make a similarly delicious pesto (recipe below). THe base of the leeks can be used as well, though we would recommend slicing the leeks very thinly and simmering low and slow when cooking to tenderize the inner fibrous stem. We\u2019re happy to again include strawberries. This is only our third season growing strawberries, so we\u2019re still developing experience, but we\u2019re thinking the lack of rain has reduced the size and yield of the strawberries, despite many hours of drip irrigating. Nothing can replace a good rain."

We seeded our tomato crop back in January, and we\u2019ve been tending to them ever since, so it\u2019s always satisfying when we finally start harvesting tomatoes. We also included green peppers, which should now continue to become more abundant, and we\u2019ll also be able to include colored peppers. The turnips have great flavor, especially when combined with potatoes, such as in the mash recipe below. The leaves are also great sauteed. July is one of our busiest months where are fields start really filling out, and if you can believe it, we\u2019re also heavily focused on the fall season ahead, as now is when we start planting our fall and winter crops. Thank you for supporting our farm, and we hope you have a safe and happy 4th of July weekend!"

We were able to direct seed fall carrots, beets, and turnips, as well as transplant onions, which will overwinter for harvest next spring. \nWe were pleased to finally be able to include yellow wax beans, and soon green beans. Our first seeding of both crops were killed during the late frost in May, so we had to reseed and we\u2019ve been patiently waiting ever since. \nAnother crop we\u2019ve been patiently waiting on is winter squash. We included spaghetti squash this week, and we hope to have more in the upcoming weeks as they begin to mature. \nThe Swiss chard bunches have wonderful crunchy stems, which can be used as a celery substitute in chicken salad, or are delicious pickled (alone or along with red onions), and then added to sandwiches or salads. \nThank you for supporting our farm and have a great week!"

July was a very busy month, full of transplanting, and we have the majority of our fall and winter crops already in the ground.

This past spring we did improve drainage along our southern growing plot by adding a trench, and we\u2019re glad we did because the drainage has improved in that area. Our next focus will be on the northern plot, so that we can avoid the water damage we\u2019re experiencing now. This week\u2019s bag has a great mix of summer vegetables that all go pretty well together, if you wanted to make one giant salad. We\u2019re nearing the end for this succession of green beans and summer squash/zucchini. We have succession crops for both but getting this late in the season is risky because both are highly pest prone. We hope you have a great week!"

Our primary goal is for our CSA customers to eat the vegetables we include in the shares, so the denser vegetables we now include more of also have a longer shelf life. We try to strike a balance, so we aim to include 1-2 leafy items per week throughout the season.

      "message": "This week we included both Swiss chard and beets, which are nearly the same plant, so you can use the beet greens in the same way you use Swiss chard. We\u2019ll only be including these vegetables once, or maybe twice, more for the season, so be sure to freeze the greens if you don\u2019t use them within a few days so that you can throw them into soups this winter. We included some vibrant sweet peppers which make a great snack. We have some really nice colored peppers for now but with the upcoming cold nights they may not last for long. We\u2019re into the final quarter of our CSA program (week 22 of 28), and we some really tasty fall vegetables growing in the fields we hope to share with you throughout these final weeks. Have a wonderful weekend!"

Our flock of sheep is starting to run out of fresh grass, so soon we will have to bed them down for the winter.

We\u2019ve spent the past few days harvesting and covering all the plants that are valuable to us as we change seasons, so our hope is we haven\u2019t overlooked anything. This week\u2019s bag has an orange theme- butternut squash, sweet potatoes, ground cherries, and carrots. We are excited to include sweet potatoes as we have been growing them all year and it feels nice to share the fruits of our hard work. They are incredibly sweet and can be used in so many great dishes. Have a great week, and enjoy the vegetables!"

THey were never sprayed with any pesticides, and we gave them a rinse, but you may find a caterpillar within the first few leaves, which you can just rinse off rather than wasting those leaves. The white onions also overwintered, which lead some of them to send up a flowering stalk in the center of the bulb. The stalk is edible, and has great flavor, but it is more fibrous than the rest of the onion, so you would want to finely chop it, or cook it until it softens. Our summer vegetables are sizing up, and we hope to include tomatoes, summer squash, and beans in the next few weeks. Have a great week!."

In between trying to keep all the plants and seedlings alive and watered, we\u2019ve put in a lot of hours and sweat into baling and stacking hay for all of our sheep for winter. We should only need to do one more big cutting of 300-400 bales to have enough hay for winter.

We do try to maximize our growing space by planting other crops such as beets and lettuce in and among\u00a0the tomatoes. We included freshly harvested white onions, and peppers, which together with the tomatoes make a delicious salsa. Later in the season we should have fresh cilantro, as long as it germinates well, which is never a guarantee. We recommend including the beet greens with the Swiss chard when cooking. They are very similar plants which taste great when sauteed or in soups. Have a great week!"

We also included kabocha winter squash in the shares. These are probably our most popular winter squash at the farmers market, but they are more perishable than a standard winter squash due to their tender skin.

We\u2019re slowly starting to harvest our winter squash in fits and starts between harvests of the more time sensitive crops- tomatoes, peppers, and summer squash/zucchini. This is our first cutting of basil for the season, so the leaves are extra tender. Basil will become cold damaged if stored below 55F, and basil also likes a high relative humidity during storage, so we would recommend leaving the basil on your countertop with just a small opening in the bag for air exposure. The winter squash should also not be refrigerated. We included a sauerrkraut recipe on the blog this week, and we highly recommend giving fermentation a try sometime. it\u2019s very simple and a delcious way to enjoy the vegetables in a new way.

This time of year we\u2019ve been including a lot of dense vegetables in the shares, which are less perishable than leafy greens such as lettuce, kale, etc. The feedback we\u2019ve received over the years is that people do enjoy the leafy greens, but they are the vegetables most likely to go bad on them, so over the years we\u2019ve worked to grow which last longer and are more versatile. Leafy vegetables also don\u2019t taste as good throughout the heat of summer, so they will be added back in more quantities once we have cooler fall weather. We are excited to include corn in the shares this week. We don\u2019t spray pesticides at our farm so corn can be challenging to grow, but we\u2019re been sampling the ears and only found minimal bugs, and have also found the ears to be sweet and juicy. We have a wonderful corn salsa recipe on the flyer and our website. Have a great week!"

      "message": "We\u2019re including more winter squash in the bags this week. We try to put most of the winter squash in the shares around this time so that we don\u2019t keep repeating the same summer vegetables, and so that it leaves room later in the season for the more diverse fall vegetables we have growing that still need time to size up. The winter squash, especially butternut and honeynut, will last for months. If you do notice a soft spot or blemish start to develop on the squash, then you will want to cook it up within a week before it spreads throughout the squash. Luckily the squash in the butternut family form harder exteriors that are less desirable to squash bugs, which poke holes in the more tender skinned winter squash. The herbs in the share are all really versatile. They make great additions to tomato sauce if you have some tomatoes you\u2019d like to cook down. everything except the basil will keep for a few in your fridge. Have a great week!"

Just a reminder that you can eat the skin of a delicata squash, though you can also eat the skin of any winter squash, but some have skins that are quite firm. We used it in a pizza recipe on the website. We included our first picking of tasty fall radishes, and we hope the crop continues to grow larger and larger each week, but with this hot weather we\u2019re crossing our fingers that they don\u2019t bolt on us and become woody.

Now all we need is some sunshine! We included a beautiful cutting of kale, which would be great finely chopped, and massaged, in a salad. A benefit of kale salads is that even once dressed they keep for a few days because the greens are thicker than lettuce. As we move into October we\u2019re keeping watch on the weather for any potential frosts. It would be great if a killing frost held off until November, like last year, so that we have another month to harvest field tomatoes, peppers, beans, summer squash, and winter squash.

We\u2019re still planting cold tolerant crops, but we won\u2019t expect to harvest them until early sping of next year. We still haven\u2019t had a killing frost yet, which is very unusual for this time of year, so our field tomatoes, peppers, and winter squash are still hanging on, but barely. This week\u2019s share has jalapeno peppers, which are the spiciest of the peppers we grow. They are dark green and small. The rest of the other peppers are sweet. We hope you enjoy our second to last CSA share, and that you have enjoyed eating through the seasons with us. Have a great week!"

If you\u2019re new to our program, here are some things that you should know- we include one recipe on this flyer, but we also have four more recipes on our website (front9farm.com/recipes) that use all of the produce in the share. We try to use minimal packaging so any leafy produce should be stored in plasticware or plastic bags to keep it humid. If you dont know how to store something ask us and we will be happy to help. We love seeing the food you make so if you ever share something on social media make sure to tag @front9farm. We have a great share to start the season. We\u2019ll be loading you up with overwintered spinach over the first few weeks since spinach doesn\u2019t grow well in the heat. If you can\u2019t eat it all within a week, it does freeze well."

More of our fruiting summer crops are starting to put on more leaves and add to their yield including our pepper and bean crops. As they continue to produce we'll rotate through the different varieties we're growing. We're not including a lot of leafy greens throughout the summer months, but cooking the tops of both the carrots and beets are a great way to still consume nutritious greens. We're thankful this season has included consistent weekly rainfall, especially compared to last year's summer drought. As long as we can keep pest and disease pressure in check, our summer crops should keep yielding well for a few months."

We just started harvesting our winter squash, so we'll be rotating through those varieties over the upcoming months. This week we included spaghetti squash, which has a noodle-like texture once it is cooked. The easiest way to cook spaghetti squash is to cut it in half, scoop out the seed cavity, and then roast it. We also included freshly harvested potatoes, which have tender and a delicious buttery flavor. Our field tomatoes are peaking with their first few flushes so we included a healthy share of roma tomatoes. They are ideal for sauce and salsa making because they have a lower water content than larger beefsteak tomatoes. They're commonly canned or frozen for later use."

The rainfall has also created an abundant mess of weeds in some sections, so we spend a solid day each week trying to tame those as well.

We have many little seedlings of fall crops throughout our fields including beets, cabbage, green onions, radishes, lettuce, and carrots. They should mature to harvestable size over the next 1-2 months. Our plan is to continue weeding and seeding over the next month or so, though the crops we seed towards the end of period won't be ready until late winter or early spring.

We covered a lot of our field tomatoes, peppers, and sweet potatoes, though thankfully the frost was pretty light and the soil has a lot of residual heat from these sunny days, so nothing was damaged. All of our crops are looking very healthy despite it being so late in the season, so we'll continue to harvest these crops until they are killed by the frost.

We're also about halfway through harvesting our sweet potatoes, so we'll let those cure for 2 weeks and then we'll include them in the final shares. We'll also have other root crops which get sweeter with the cold weather that we will include in the final shares. We hope you enjoy the last of the summer crops, because once they're gone we won't have them again until next summer."
