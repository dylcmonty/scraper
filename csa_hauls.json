      "Welcome to week 1 of our CSA program! We’re very excited for what we have in store for you this season. This season we will be creating a blog each week with 5 detailed recipes which utilize many, if not all of the ingredients in the week's package. This week's share includes many perennial herbs, which take off faster in the spring than the annual crops and offer an abundance of unique flavors. Check out our week 1 recipes below!"
